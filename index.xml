      <description>Why i built my own Bookmarking app ( lynks.in  ) Its 2018 and bookmarking apps have been mainstream since at-least last 10 years. There are plenty of options available in the market already, so why exactly do we need yet another bookmarking appÂ ?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see  I have been a heavy bookmark user since last many years. Needless to say that i have tried variety of bookmarks app over the years yet i always felt that none of them provides all the functionalities that i always wanted.</description>

      <description>WHAT IS DOCKER ? To put it simply, Docker is a way of packing &amp;amp; distributing software.
WHY DO WE NEED DOCKER ?  Let&amp;rsquo;s say your are building a python application using Django. You can provide list of python dependencies/packages needed for the project inside requirements.txt file. Let&amp;rsquo;s say one of the dependency is celery. For celery to work it will need a backend ( let&amp;rsquo;s say we are using rabbitmq as backend for celery) For the project to work on a system you will have to install rabbitmq separately.</description>
