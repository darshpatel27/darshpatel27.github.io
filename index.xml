      <description>Why i built my own Bookmarking app ( lynks.in  ) Its 2018 and bookmarking apps have been mainstream since at-least last 10 years. There are plenty of options available in the market already, so why exactly do we need yet another bookmarking appÂ ?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see  I have been a heavy bookmark user since last many years. Needless to say that i have tried variety of bookmarks app over the years yet i always felt that none of them provides all the functionalities that i always wanted.</description>
