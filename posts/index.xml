      <description>Recently i have set-up this blog using Hugo. I was able to do it over a weekend. It was a fun &amp;amp; rewarding experience. If you are interested in setting up a static blog/website all you have to do is follow these 6 simple steps
1) Select your theme
 Hugo has a wide variety of themes to select from. Pick your favorite [here] (https://themes.gohugo.io)
 2) Setting it up locally</description>

      <description>Why i built my own Bookmarking app ( [ lynks.in ] ( https://lynks.in ) ) Its 2018 and bookmarking apps have been mainstream since at-least last 10 years. There are plenty of options available in the market already, so why exactly do we need yet another bookmarking appÂ ?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see    I have been a heavy bookmark user since last many years. Needless to say that i have tried variety of bookmarks app over the years yet i always felt that none of them provides all the functionalities that i always wanted.</description>

      <description>WHAT IS DOCKER ? To put it simply, Docker is a way of packing &amp;amp; distributing software.
WHY DO WE NEED DOCKER ?   Let&amp;rsquo;s say your are building a Python application using Django. You can provide list of Python dependencies/packages needed for the project inside requirements.txt file.
  Let&amp;rsquo;s say one of the dependency is celery. For celery to work it will need a backend ( let&amp;rsquo;s say we are using rabbitmq as backend for celery)</description>
